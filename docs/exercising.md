There are 2 ways to exercise grants:
- Opening an exercising window: A time window where employees can choose if they want to exercise and how many is set.
- Directly: Collaborators can set the exercised amount

## Opening an exercising window

1. First you will have to setup the [exercising details](https://www.capboard.io/api/docs/endpoints#/companies/post_api_companies__id__setup_exercising) which consists on setting which collaborators will be able to approve or deny exercising requests, as well as indicating the payment details that will be shown to employees once their exercising is approved.

2. Now an [exercising window](https://www.capboard.io/api/docs/endpoints#/grants/post_api_grants_exercising_periods) can be opened.
